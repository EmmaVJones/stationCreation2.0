# stationCreation2.0
This repo holds scripts to run a station creation shiny app hosted on Connect service. All data are available on the internal R server. Using this tool, uers only need a lat/lng to discover underlying spatial information about proposed sampling location for entry into CEDS, reducing the manual GIS work required of regional assessors.
